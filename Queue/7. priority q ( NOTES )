      where elements are processed based on their size

                                           f       r
    1) normal insertion     -------------> 5 4 2 7 9
       delete according to priority    --> 5 4 7 9 .  // 2 was deleted
                                           f     r

    2) special insertion   --> while inserting in a sorted manner
       delete normally

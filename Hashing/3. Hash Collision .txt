What is a Hash Collision?
A hash collision occurs when two different keys map to the same index in a hash table. 
This can happen even with a good hash function, especially if the hash table 
is full or the keys are similar.



Causes of Hash Collisions:
1) Poor Hash Function: A hash function that does not distribute keys evenly
                       across the hash table can lead to more collisions.
2) High Load Factor: A high load factor (ratio of keys to hash table size) 
                     increases the probability of collisions.
3) Similar Keys: Keys that are similar in value or structure are more likely to collide.



Collision Resolution Techniques :
There are two types of collision resolution techniques:

1} Open Addressing:
a) Linear Probing: Search for an empty slot sequentially
b) Quadratic Probing: Search for an empty slot using a quadratic function

2} Closed Addressing:
a) Chaining: Store colliding keys in a linked list or binary search tree at each index
b) Cuckoo Hashing: Use multiple hash functions to distribute keys
(add in the same block using a linked list)

Hash Function :

The hash function is a function that takes a key and returns an index into the hash table. 
The goal of a hash function is to distribute keys evenly across the hash table, 
and minimizing collisions (when two keys map to the same index).



Common hash functions include:

1) Division Method: Key % Hash Table Size
2) Multiplication Method: (Key * Constant) % Hash Table Size
3) Universal Hashing: A family of hash functions designed to minimize collisions

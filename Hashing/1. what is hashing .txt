What is Hashing in Data Structure?

Hashing is a technique used in data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently. 
It involves using a hash function to map data items to a 
fixed-size array which is called a hash table.

ex:
    12 , address of 12 is 12%10 = 2 
    19 , address of 19 is 19%10 = 9    like this


1) Hash Function: You provide your data items into the hash function.
2) Hash Code: The hash function crunches the data and give a unique hash code.
3) Hash Table: The hash code then points you to a specific location within the hash table.


Hash Table in Data Structure :
A hash table is also known as a hash map. It is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. 
It uses a hash function to map keys to a fixed-size array, called a hash table. 
This allows in faster search, insertion, and deletion operations.


1) It is a type of binary tree.
2) All nodes of the left subtree are lesser than the node itself.
3) All nodes of the right subtree are greater than the node itself.
4) Left and Right subtrees are also binary trees.
5) There are no duplicate nodes.

6) the InOrder traversal of a binary search tree gives an ascending sorted array.

note* min element = InOrder pre
      max element = InOrder post

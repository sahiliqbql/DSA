TREE:  it is non-lenear 
       use - ideal for represnting hierarchical data.
       n nodes = (n-1) edges

    1) Root : topest node

    2) parents: node which connect to the child

    3) child: node which connect to the parents

    4) Leaf / external node: nodes with no child

    5) internal node: node with atleast one child

    6) Depth: no of edges from Root

    7) Height: no of edges from node to deepest Leaf

    8) Sibling: nodes belonging to the same parents

    9) ancestor / Descendent: any other node on the path from the node to the Root
                            or A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an "ancestor". 
                                The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of the ancestor node.

Binary Tree: Binary Tree is a Tree which has at most 2 child for all the nodes.

    1) Full / Strict: all node has 0 or 2 children

    2) Perfect Binary tree : internal nodes have 2 children
                            all Leaf nodes on same level
                        
    3) Complete Binary tree : all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level 
                            and the last level has all keys as left as possible.

    4) Degenerate / pathological tree : all parent node has exactly 1 child

    5) Skewed Binary Tree: A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree 
                        in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes.
                        i) left-skewed binary tree
                        ii) right-skewed binary tree

Represnting of Binary Tree:

    1) Array Represnting : can't insert element after Array was Full

What is an AVL Tree?
1) Height balanced binary search trees
2) Hieght difference between heights of left and right subtrees for every node is
   less than or equal to 1.
3) Balanced factor = Height of right subtree - Height of left subtree 
4) Can be -1, 0 or 1 for a node to be balanced in a Binary search tree 
5) Can be -1, 0 or 1 for all nodes of an AVL tree

Balancing a AVL tree after insertion
In order to balance an AVL tree after insertion, we can follow the following rules:
1) For a Left-Left Insertion - Right rotate once wrt the first imbalanced node 
2) For a Right-Right Insertion -Left rotate once wrt the first imbalanced node 
3) For a Left-Right Insertion - Left rotate once and then Right rotate once 
4) For a Right-Left Insertion - Right rotate once and then Left rotate once

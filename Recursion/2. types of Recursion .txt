1) Direct Recursion : Direct recursion is a type of recursion in which a function calls itself directly.

2) Indirect Recursion : Indirect recursion is a type of recursion in which two or more functions 
                        call each other in a circular manner to achieve a common goal.
                        A --> B --> A

3) Tail Recursion : Tail recursion is defined as a recursive function in which the recursive call 
                    is the last statement that is executed by the function. 
                    So basically nothing is left to execute after the recursion call.

4) Non Tail/ Head Recursion : While non-tail recursion involves other operations after the recursive call.

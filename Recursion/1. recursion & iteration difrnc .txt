(R) A program is called recursive when an entity calls itself. 
(I) A program is called iterative when there is a loop (or repetition).

Code Size : (R)	Smaller code size	
            (I) Larger Code Size.

Stack : (R)	When a recursive function is called, the computer uses a stack 
            to remember which function call it is currently processing. 
            Each time the function is called, a new stack frame is created and added to the top of the stack.

            This frame contains the function's local variables, parameters and the return address.
        (I) Stack is not used.

Time Complexity	: (R) Very high(generally exponential) time complexity.	
                  (I) Relatively lower time complexity(generally polynomial-logarithmic).

Space Complexity: (R) The space complexity is higher than iterations.              
                  (I) Space complexity is lower.

Memory : (R) Recursion uses more memory as compared to iteration.
         (I) Iteration uses less memory as compared to recursion.


Speed : (R)	Execution is slow since it has the overhead of maintaining and updating the stack.
        (I) Normally, it is faster than recursion as it doesnâ€™t utilize the stack.

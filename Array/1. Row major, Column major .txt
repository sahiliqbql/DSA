Row Major Order: Row major ordering assigns successive elements,
                 moving across the rows and then down the next row, 
                 to successive memory locations. 
                 In simple language, the elements of an array are stored in a Row-Wise fashion.

Column Major Order: If elements of an array are stored in a column-major fashion 
                    means moving across the column and then to the next column 
                    then itâ€™s in column-major order.


ADDRESS: in A[m][n] (B.A = base address);

Row major: A[i][j] = B.A + (i*n + j) * size of data type

Column major: A[i][j] = B.A + (j*m + i) * size of data type
